> After graduating from the University of St Andrews, and later the University of Central Lancashire, I spent over two years working as a researcher in a counter-extremism think tank. Though the work I was doing was very close to my heart, I was routinely frustrated with the abstract nature of our work, wondering often whether there was any way to measure the impact or success of our efforts. This concern eventually led to me delving into the world of coding and programming, which has now given me the essential foundation and grounding with which to translate my experience into practical goals and tangible productions.

> During my time at Makers, a 16-week intensive coding bootcamp, I've been introduced to several languages, libraries, and frameworks. In particular, we have focused on Ruby, but also dabbled in JavaScript. During this time, I've also self-taught myself some Python and Node.js. But perhaps the most valuable thing I've taken away from my time at Makers is the skill to cultivate a healthy growth mindset, which in turn has taught me to self-teach and self-drive my progress.

**Interpersonal**

*Analytical thinker*


Having done Philosophy both as an A Level, and later at St Andrews, I am a keen analytical and critical thinker. I love delving into logic puzzles and analysing an issue from all sides to crack the solutiom and solving multi-layer problems, which is exactly why coding excites me.

*Excellent communication skills*


I have extensive past experience in research and media, and am therefore skilled at adapting communications strategies based on target audiences. I have also taken part in several emotional intelligence workshops, which have helped me to develop more effective and productive communication skills.

*Exceptionally fast learner*


I am very good at taking on new projects, whether that be building a program or learning a whole new language. I am very methodical with planning which helps ensure that I almost always achieve my goals in the set amount of time. I am always eager to learn new skills and continue to grow my knowledge.

*Thrive both in agile dynamic teams and on solo projects*


I am highly adaptable to varying work environments, having worked effectively with varying team dynamics and work environments.

### Education

------

**Makers Academy**

*January 2020*

A 16-week intensive development bootcamp with a focus on:
